# datastream_clustering
Implementation of incrementally data stream clustering algorithm including GNG, GWR and algorithm test.

Input: PLT or CSV or TXT file with the first two columns as geolocation and the rest for the other feats.
Output: CSV file with the former columns as data as the last columns as cluster number.
Visualization: Using folium map for visualizing data points or showing cluster centers.
Test data: A user's "Geolife Trajactories Dataset" record, which contains the geographic location at different times of the day.
